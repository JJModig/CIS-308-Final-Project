# CIS-308-Final-Project
This is an insult generator. It uses randomized substitution.
It randomly chooses an insult sentence form and randomly substitutes
one word from a list of suitable words.
The list of words used in the program are found in dictionary.txt.
forms.h and forms.c contain the structure for different forms of insults.
list.h contains an implementation for a dynamic array of strings.
The file I/O, console I/O, and general functionality of the program is
naively included in main.c.
